Final Year Project: 
Title:             Memcached Proxy Driver for Aerospike Client.
Summary:  In this project we dealt with the problem of how to provide caching solutions to the clients those who were using memcached, which is of not much use when we want to extend. So Aerospike, a NoSQL DataBase service provider which can deal with problems of extensibility, want to provide caching solutions even to the clients having memcached implementations written in various languages. So our proxy driver written in C translates the memcached request to Aerospike request and response vice versa.
